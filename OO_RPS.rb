# Rock, Paper, Scissors is a two-player game where each player chooses
# one of three possible moves: rock, paper, or scissors. The chosen moves
# will then be compared to see who wins, according to the following rules:

# - rock beats scissors
# - scissors beats paper
# - paper beats rock

# If the players chose the same move, then it's a tie.

# Nouns: player, move, rule
# Verbs: choose, compare
